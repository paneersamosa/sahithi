              <p>CoachArt is a non-profit organization that connects kids affected by serious illnesses with volunteers from all over the world to allow kids to learn an art/skill. These volunteers can request supplies that are necessary for a lesson or request reimbursement after purchasing.</p> 
              <p>However, both of these forms were set up as lengthy Google Forms, requiring a lot of manual labor from CoachArt's end in regards to inputting the data into a separate financial management platform.</p>
              <p>My role in this project was to redesign the content from the unstyled Google Forms into an intuitive, visually pleasing webpage that could be integrated into their website. This would allow for the devs to create a software that could pull data from the form and generate automatic pdf invoices that could be uploaded onto the financial management platform.</p>

          <p>After we were provided with the both of the Google Forms, we brainstormed how we wanted to take the Google Form fields and organize them. Christine and I wrote down every single field from both forms (the Reimbursement and Supply Request forms), and began grouping together information that we felt belonged together.</p>
          <p>Puppy Tsai, our point of contact with CoachArt, provided us with a PRD with the following requirements:</p>

          <p>Once we had all the necessary information together, we began to brainstorm potential layouts that the new webpages could have through wireframe sketches.</p>
